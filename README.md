Voici le résultat de la commande `terraform plan` pour le réseau :

```text
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_network.vpc_network will be created
  + resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
      + auto_create_subnetworks                   = true
      + delete_default_routes_on_create           = false
      + gateway_ipv4                              = (known after apply)
      + id                                        = (known after apply)
